            <p>The son of a rubber tapper, Francisco Alves Mendes Filho was born in Xapuri, in the interior of Acre, in 1944. From a young age, he worked in the forest and became literate at the age of 19.</p>
            <p>In 1975, at the age of 31, Mendes began his work as a unionist and activist in defense of the Amazon Forest. Until his death, in 1988, this was his mission.</p>
            <p>He created the Rural Workers Union of Xapuri (AC) and was the organizer of the Union of Forest Peoples - an alliance between indigenous people, rubber tappers, Brazil nut gatherers, small fishermen and riverine populations that could be threatened by the deforestation of the region.</p>
            <p>His militancy made the ranchers uncomfortable. One of his actions to impede the advance of tractors over the forests, for example, was the so-called "empate", when entire families (women and children in the lead) would sit in an organized way near the machines, inhibiting deforestation.</p>

            </blockquote>
            <p>In "Chico Mendes, crime and punishment" (2003, Companhia das Letras), journalist Zuenir Ventura, who covered the assassination of the trade unionist, describes that he developed peaceful resistance tactics to defend the forest, which from the 1970s on suffered an accelerated process of deforestation to make way for large cattle pastures.</p>
            <p>Indeed, his struggle has been recognized internationally. In 1987, Mendes spoke at the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) meeting in Miami (USA), denouncing the destruction of the forest. The following year, in 1988, he won the Global 500, a United Nations award, and the Better World Society's Environment Medal.</p>
            <p>At the same time that he was being recognized internationally, in Xapuri death threats increased every day. "The promises of regularization of land conflicts did not materialize. The idea of creating extractive reserves dragged on in the federal bureaucracy," states the website of the Chico Mendes Memorial, created in 1996 by the National Rubber Tappers Council (CNS).</p>
            <p>Militancy could not save him. On December 22, 1988, in an ambush at the back of his house, he was murdered by Darrly Alves on behalf of his father, Darcy Alves, a land grantee.</p>
            <p>Chico Mendes' killers were arrested and sentenced to 19 years in prison, thanks to the testimony of Gen√©sio Ferreira da Silva, who was 13 years old at the time and witnessed the whole preparation of the death.</p>
